# syslinux-preview

### What?
Preview what a syslinux config will look like

This is very old (and shitty) code. It probably doesn't even work anymore, but
when it did, it used SFML 2.3.1, so you need to install that to use this

### Usage

`syslinuxpreview [file1] [file2] ...`

Replace [file1], [file2], etc... with the file names of your config files

### Controls
- Up key: Upper the selected menu.
- Down key: Lower the selected menu.
- Left key: Go page up.
- Right key: Go page down.
- A...Z, 0...9 and Space: Use menu hotkey.
- Return: "Boot" menu entry.
